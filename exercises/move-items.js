/**
 * @task
 * Iterate through the every item in allItems NodeList and apply the
 * addEventListener click event to each item.
 * The item click must execute/call the following:
 * * Get the current item's parent id ('main' or 'favs')
 * * Get the current item id (a number value)
 * * Set the direction constant to be equal to 'toFavs' or 'toMain', based off the current location
 * * The direction means the collection to move the item into, when the item is clicked
 * * If the correct item's location is the parent of id 'main' -> the direction is 'toFavs'
 * * If the correct item's location is the parent of id 'favs' -> the direction is 'toMain'
 * * Make the updateCollections function call, assign the item Id and the direction defined above
